            "body": "This proposal is for the Crisis DAO Charter. Please review the charter and vote below. \n\n* Please vote **yes** to pass the charter. \n* If you want to revisit and go back to the drawing board, vote **no**.\n\nYou can visit the charter here: https://hackmd.io/PIH8UL0oQOeB10xyLvhpmw?edit\n\nCharter is below:\n----\n\n## 1. About Crisis DAO\n\n### Why it exists\n    \nCrisisDAO started when a group of technologists deliberately set out to recruit people from diverse backgrounds drawn by a common interest to explore the use of bleeding-edge technologies in the blockchain. Through tinkering, peer learning, and mentoring, we investigate new types of organizational decision-making to decipher what incentives may look like for an equitable organization.\n\nOur thesis is that by building an investment DAO based on a frictionless, open, self-governing, cross-border agreement at scale and speed, we can create more sustainable and equitable participation and control and be more financially profitable than traditional companies.\n    \n### Mission\n    \nCrisisDAO is dedicated to creating open, self-governing, financially successful, blockchain-driven, cross-border agreement at scale and speed.\n    \n### Vision\n    \nTo make CrisisDAO a new model for organizing human endeavors incorruptible, immutable, and equitable.\n\n### Defining Success\n    \nIf the CrisisDAO is successful, we will prove our protocols and systems work by having outsized financial returns with minimal harm on the earth or any living creature; and by increasing participation of our members and by others replicating our documented learnings.\n    \nA successful DAO is one that makes progress toward the future as described in the vision. This means five things:\n    \n1. Members are participating.\n2. Proposals are created, a portion of which are successful.\n3. Financial gains are realised. \n4. Lessons are learned, laws (code) are written or amended.\n5. The process from 2 to 4 is documented so as to increase both participation of members and the learning of how DAO\u2019s work.\n\n\n---\n\n## 2. Members Privileges and Obligations\n\nLike a co-operative, members have the privilege to enjoy rewards, and in return, they have shared responsibilities toward a common goal. The CrisisDAO requires high member participation to be successful; it is not for spectators, therefore we as members:\n\n1. Participate in the discussion, creation, voting and documentation of proposals.\n2. Make friction, tension and inefficiencies known to all DAO members, so that changes, improvements and learning can take place.\n3. Monitor and record progress, for the creation of metrics to measure DAO health.\n\n### Membership Requirements\n\n* By contributing to the DAO, you agree to be governed by this Charter\n* Agree with the Code of Ethics\n* Comply with the Code of Conduct\n* Participate in the official communications channels on a regular basis\n* [Link to Membership Document](https://hackmd.io/WYOfX4VfTmqJidQZWkP5dQ)\n\n### New Members\n\nCrisisDAO is open to all. However, we are temporarily restricting membership until processes/software allows for safe scaling of DAO. For details on safety, see [security team doc](https://hackmd.io/4_FDfBnPQbqGI7IuoZoEbw).\n\n### Code of Conduct and Ethics\n\nSee annex [Code of Conduct draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsH5YjkvkZW2LSoakjivk4wzPupAW7R0WsWjrR8laT0/edit?usp=sharing).\nSee annex [Code of Ethics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GpEgORanfwwvrG8x4L6EYLmJ8nQ0RzJXtSh9uQW10Dk/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n### Resolving Conflicts\n\nConflicts and disagreements are normal and part of any human endeavor. As a brand new organization, CrisisDAO doesn\u2019t have all the answers yet. Members are expected to apply our values in creating and modifying the instruments for conflict resolution.\nSee annexure [Resolving conflict](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LFPuEd7asvzpCUc-LnWBdgeztRcokaesylEDmxOWn5Q/edit#heading=h.vorb1hmx6g5h).\n\n### Taxes\n\nTaxes are a Member\u2019s own responsibility. Nothing the DAO or the members provide constitutes legal advice.\n\n\n---\n\n## 3. DAO Operations and Governance\n\nDAOs are decentralized organizations. The CrisisDAO builds on shared interests managed through open and secure software that will help in the DAO\u2019s governance. As we experiment with its day to day operations, we should always consider:\n\n1. Is our operation following the long-term vision of CrisisDAO?\n2. If the solution is repeatable and should be coded into software.\n\n### Operating Agreement\n\nThe DAO is currently using the [Operating Agreement from May 27, 2021](https://hackmd.io/8kB9cHYXQIyOZj-VFcIR6g). Any changes to the Operating Agreement must be proposed and passed.\n\n### Proposals\n\n* All Proposals will conform to the default time periods of:\n    * 2 days to vote\n    * and quorum thresholds unless classified as a different type of Proposal.\n* The Quorum threshold is defined by the minimum number of tokens that have voted in the proposal. \n    * The default quorum threshold is 30% of governance tokens in circulation. E.g. If we have 1000 total tokens in circulation, then we\u2019ll need 300 tokens to reach the quorum threshold.\n    * The DAO may propose different types of proposals that require a higher or lower threshold.\n    * The DAO may change the default quorum threshold.\n* A proposal may be re-proposed one time, subject to substantive differences in environment, market or circumstance.\n\n### Delegation\n\nThe DAO allows members to explicitly delegate their votes to another member and remove the delegation at any time for any reason.\n\n### Security\n\nFunds, assets and data must be secured by the DAO security team. Details at [https://hackmd.io/4_FDfBnPQbqGI7IuoZoEbw](https://hackmd.io/4_FDfBnPQbqGI7IuoZoEbw)\n\n## 4. Building the DAO Future\n\nCRISIS DAO intends to eventually open membership to the public. During the pre-public phase we are measuring health based on a set of parameters that are flexible to accommodate learning and incentive-based to encourage participation and propel development and growth. Health measurements will surely change as learning accelerates and membership expands. We cannot anticipate all problems, but the hope is that gaps in procedure will be filled through amendments (proposals).\n\n## DAO Health\n\nSince the thesis of CrisisDAO is that our hive-mind is superior to just one ape brain, our goal is to align the DAO members to a shared set of objectives and encourage participation in the activities to achieve key results. The KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are measurements we use to evaluate how the DAO is performing over time. The baseline KPIs include financials, member engagement, and proposals. The measurements will answer questions such as, how is the investment portfolio performing, what percentage of proposals are contributing to deal flow, and how many members are actively participating in voting. The indicators will be measured real-time, monthly or seasonally and will be accessible by all members. \n[Examples of the KPIs can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1SonPuLyGwhzCTsgwvzcSsP68PeexjVzlYIkK-lHWk/edit#).\n\n### Knowledge Sharing\n\nTo accelerate the world\u2019s transition to equitable and just governance, we must document our stories and share them with the world. All of our documentations are [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) by default. Members are encouraged to share our stories via social media and conferences.\n\n### Epochs\n\nEpochs are a defined season of DAO operations. Epoch 1 is from now until 12/31/2021. For example: If by the end of 2021, we have lost money, we can sell and tax harvest our losses. If we have gains, we can propose taking the gains on 1/1 or continuing the DAO. \n\nThe DAO members will vote on the renewal of the DAO for one or more new Epochs before the end of each Epoch.\n",

            "body": "\n\nMembers of the CrisisDAO are a global community. Our diversity of location, gender, age, and life experience is valuable within the DAO, and because of this, it takes honesty, respect, and kindness to work together.  The code of conduct is not a set of rules to be gamed or boxes to be checked. As an inclusive and open culture,  processes are in place to address issues as they arise.\n\nIn keeping with our open source ethos we have remixed aspects of the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (v3, https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), the Open Humans Code of Conduct (201912) https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/pull/1086/files \n\nThis Code of Conduct applies whenever you participate in CrisisDAO online and offline spaces including when you:\n* Participate in our online communication spaces, including Discord and other forums\n* Participate in DAO events and in-person spaces\n* Working with other DAO community members\n* Representing the DAO at public events\n* Speak on behalf of the DAO on social media\n\nIn CrisisDAO spaces all people are safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of: background, family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location and any other dimension of diversity.\n\nOpenness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. Our community is a place for critical discussion and learning - where all subjects can be addressed, all critiques can be heard.  Learning will only take place if the environment is genuine, thoughtful, honest and kind.  That is why we insist that you:\n\nBe Courteous\nThe respect you receive is equal to what you give out, what you give yourself and the world around you. Value each other\u2019s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be courteous in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact on others and how intense interactions may be affecting people. \n \nBe constructive \nTake responsibility for how you come across and your mistakes \u2013 if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologise sincerely, and change your behaviour in future.\n\nBe Clear but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about when criticism is respectful and when it\u2019s not. We must be able to speak clearly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don\u2019t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful. \nBe grateful for the opportunity to hear different perspectives from others. Even when you don't accept them, hear them out. We respect people even when we don\u2019t respect beliefs.\n\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people\u2019s participation whether they are remote (on video or phone); not native language speakers; from a different culture; in a different time zone or facing other challenges to participation. Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. \n\nChoose to be silent\nSometimes when we participate in conversations we feel the need to be silent, whether it is because we are becoming frustrated and don\u2019t want to say something we shouldn\u2019t or because the topic is sensitive for us. Tell others that you don\u2019t want to talk about that issue right now, or that the topic is personal and you aren\u2019t willing to discuss it. That is true for others too, so if someone communicates that they don\u2019t want to talk about something then respect their silence.\n\nBe Aware\nAsk yourself, how may my actions and words make other people feel for example, how will inappropriate nudity, out of control drunkeness, inappropriate physical contact and  sexual imagery, religious, racial, homophobic or cultural insults affect others? Be aware that others may have different attitudes on these issues and may not intend to cause offence. It may be necessary to make them aware how their behaviour affects you.\n\nDon\u2019t assume that everyone is like you. \n\nWhether your behaviour has caused someone else discomfort or their behaviour has caused you discomfort this is an opportunity for growth. Communicate clearly and respectfully, listen patiently, learn and grow as a person. \n \nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to \u201cwin\u201d every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. \u201cWinning\u201d is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nYou may not know the full story, listen.\n \nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others\u2019 needs from their point of view. Use preferred names and pronouns and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people\u2019s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes.  Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors.\nBehavior That Will Not Be Tolerated\nThe following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.\nThe Code has set out the behaviour we expect. Obviously the converse is true. If it is not obvious to you that the behaviour we expect does not include threatening violence, doxxing or insulting people then you can\u2019t be part of our community. If your hurtful actions or words are a crime we may report them to the authorities. \n \nViolence and Threats of Violence\nViolence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people\u2019s personally identifying information (\u201cdoxxing\u201d) online.\n\nPersonal Attacks\nConflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.\n\nDerogatory Language\nHurtful or harmful language related to:\n* Background\n* Family status\n* Gender\n* Gender identity or expression\n* Marital status\n* Sex\n* Sexual orientation\n* Native language\n* Age\n* Ability\n* Race and/or ethnicity\n* Caste\n* National origin\n* Socioeconomic status\n* Religion\n* Geographic location\n* Other attributes\n* Diet/Vegan \nis not acceptable.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure if a word is derogatory, don\u2019t use it. When asked to stop, stop the behaviour in question.\n\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact\nUnwelcome sexual attention and unwelcome physical contact are not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.\n\nYou are entitled to tell other people when their attention or behaviour makes you uncomfortable.\n\nDisruptive Behaviour\nSustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:\n* \u2018Talking over\u2019 or \u2018heckling\u2019 speakers.\n* Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.\n* Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering. \n* Commenting negatively about other people\u2019s choices\n* Inappropriate nudity\n* Disparaging people\u2019s dietary preferences\n* Discriminating against vegans and other philosophical, religious beliefs \n* Influencing Unacceptable Behaviour\n\nWe will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.\n\nModification \nAs with all things open source this is a work in progress. We will revisit it from time to time. When we do, the new code will apply to all DAO spaces.\n\n\n---\n",

CrisisDAO Members are people with families and friends, and may have businesses, professions, investments, property interests, and other connections to different communities.\n\nWhen any Member is placed in a situation that they may have a financial interest, personal activity or relationship that could impair their ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the DAO, report their conflict to the Membership Team and must recuse themselves from voting.\n\nIf any Member believes another Member has a conflict of interest, this should be discussed with the Member in question.  If both members are not able to decide if a conflict may occur, they are to discuss with the Membership Team.\n\nConflicts of interest should be documented publicly on the Discord by the Membership Team.\n\n\nConflict of personality:\n\nWhen someone contravenes the Code of Conduct, offends or makes a member uncomfortable, this is the process that we follow. \n\nIf you are offended or uncomfortable and able to do so then please start off by talking to the person who has offended you, preferably in a non threatening environment that you feel most uncomfortable in, be it public or private. Explain to them how what they said or did offended you and that it is inappropriate in our community. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel able to speak to someone alone then ask someone else from the community to be present in the conversation. Don\u2019t know who to ask? Then ask one of the Membership team, if the problem is with one of the Membership team then ask the Operations team.\n\nIf someone approaches you and tells you that something you have done or said is offensive then listen to them. Try to understand their point of view. It is easy to feel offended or defensive at this point but most people really appreciate an honest attempt to listen and understand. We believe that you will come to an understanding. \n\nYou may not feel able to speak directly to the person who has offended you even with someone else present. Perhaps you feel there is a power imbalance or something else inhibiting dialogue. If so then speak to the Membership team about the problem. The Membership team will probably ask to meet with both you and the other person to discuss the issue. If you agree to meet with the other person then you can also have someone from the community to support you in the meeting. The Membership team may also bring in others as they feel is appropriate.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to meet with the person the Membership team may meet with them and then again with you to see what resolution may be reached.\n\nIf someone refuses to behave in an appropriate way then that person may be excluded from CrisisDAO convened spaces. The Membership Team will define the steps that will be taken.  The steps will always involve communication, learning and a calm phased, appropriate approach. If that happens then the CrisisDAO may choose to speak publicly about it if that seems appropriate but it certainly doesn\u2019t have to do so.\n\nThis is a process. It takes time. Be patient.\n\nIt is not appropriate to first air your grievances on social media. In the same way it is not appropriate to complain publicly about people without first following the process. If you do so then you may make it difficult or impossible for our process to operate through eroding trust.\n\nA note on conflict:\n\nConflict gives us an opportunity to learn and grow.  We should all aim to examine our own actions and reactions in the spirit of generosity, good will and evolution. \n\nModification \n\nAs with all things open source this is a work in progress. We will revisit it from time to time. When we do, the new code will apply to all CrisisDAO spaces.\n\n",
